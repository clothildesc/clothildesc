ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Clothilde, a curious and creative developer currently studying at [Ã‰cole 42](https://42.fr), a peer-to-peer coding school with a hands-on, project-based curriculum and no teachers. Since April 2025, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into low-level programming in C, shell scripting, algorithms, and collaborative coding.

Before 42, I transitioned into web development after a career in marketing and a full-time bootcamp at Le Wagon. I built several web applications using Ruby on Rails and loved bringing ideas to life through code.
